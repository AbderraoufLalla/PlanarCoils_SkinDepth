# PlanarCoils_SkinDepth
This Python script calculates copper skin depth at a specific frequency to optimize coil design. Skin depth shows how deep current penetrates into a conductor, decreasing as frequency increases. The script recommends the optimal copper thickness to reduce resistive losses in high-frequency applications
